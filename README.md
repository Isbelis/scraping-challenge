# web-scraping-challenge
# Introduction

After learning to identify HTML elements on a page, extract information using automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup, and scrape various types of data like HTML tables and recurring elements from webpages, this challenge presents a full web-scraping and data analysis project. This project allows you to strengthen core skills in data collection, organization, storage, analysis, and visualization.

# Content
This assignment consists of two technical deliverables:

## Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

- Opened part_1_mars_news-analysis.ipynb to scrape titles and preview text from the Mars News website.
- Used Beautiful Soup to extract elements and store results in Python dictionaries.
- Exported data to a JSON file for easy sharing.


## Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

- Opened part_2_mars_weather_analysis.ipynb to scrape and analyze Mars weather data.
- Visited the Mars Temperature Data Site using automated browsing.
- Used Beautiful Soup to scrape HTML table data and assemble it into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Analyzed the dataset to answer specific questions using Pandas functions.
- Exported the DataFrame to a CSV file for further use.
